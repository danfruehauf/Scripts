# Scripts Repository

Little utilities which do not deserve their own repository. I try to keep them
in a sane state. They can and should be reused.

Currently in:
 * snapshot_backup - My reliable script for creating a nice snapshot backup
 * shk - Simple Hardening Kit, to help you toughen up your little box
 * bash_scripting_conventions - My Bash scripting conventions, keeping things tidy
 * spapn-files - A utility to span files from one large directory onto small devices
 * spread_files - A utility to spread files from enourmosly big directories (+1000000 files and more)
 * nagios - Nagios plugins
