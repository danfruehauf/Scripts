# Scripts Repository

Little utilities which do not deserve their own repository. I try to keep them
in a sane state. They can and should be reused.

Currently in:
 * bash_scripting_conventions - Bash scripting conventions that I use
 * cluster-config - "Infrstructure" to orchestrate and build clusters. Made obsolete by Chef/Puppet :/
 * mock-hosts - A utility to mock lines in `/etc/hosts`, very useful for testing
 * nagios - Nagios plugins were moved to [another repository](https://github.com/danfruehauf/nagios-plugins)
 * ninja-merge - A N-way directory merge with collision detection and handling
 * shk - Simple Hardening Kit, to help you toughen up your little box
 * snapshot_backup - My reliable script for creating a nice snapshot backup
 * span-files - A utility to span files from one large directory onto small devices
 * spread_files - A utility to spread files from enourmosly big directories (+1000000 files and more)
